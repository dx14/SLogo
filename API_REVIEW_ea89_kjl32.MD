##API REVIEW

Efe Aras and a girl named Karen who I just met (Still no idea who she is) (She seems nice and ethical)

### Part 1

Our design is good because we separate all our components into different components. We will catch the exceptions thrown by the back end and display a popup. We have a MainGUI class that instantiates all the GUIComponents. By using an extensive inheritance hieararch, we allow for easy integration of new components into our project because it forces them to implement a method.

### Part 2

Use cases: 

1. Type a text and press enter 
2. Double click on history
3. Change the image of a turtle
4. Adding tabs

I am super hyped about finishing my GUI and making sure that turtles can swim safely in my drawing area.

I am terrified of super long classes because in the previous project, my partners who did GUI wrote a 850 LINE CLASS FOR THE GUI BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS NECESSARY. Thus, I want to extensively employ inheritance.

I started on MainGUI because I like the topdown approach.
